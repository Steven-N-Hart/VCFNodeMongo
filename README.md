# VCFNodeMongo

Scripts I have right now:

1. VCF_sampleParse.js
	
	Usage: VCF_import.js **vcf_file** **study_name**

	This script takes a VCF and imports it into the mongodb database
	Known issues:
		Doesn't automatically close when finished

1. VCF_export.js
	Was working for another project but needs to be modified for this one
